# Type-Top
A minimal theme focused on clear typography and reduced visual clutter.
Features sensible typographic defaults, detailed typographic
configuration options, and a prepackaged selection of some of the best open licensed
fonts.

Comes with an academic bent.

## Features
1. Reduced visual clutter:
   1. Option for trailing character to indicate a url instead of underlining.
   2. Navigation header not underlined.
2. Sensible typographic defaults:
   1. Font-family-specific line spacing and font height.
   2. Real small caps.
   3. Headings, captions, and script-sizes use appropriate font variations instead of scaling the regular font.
3. Typographic configuration
   1. An number of professionally designed font options available under the Open
      Font License: IBM Plex (Mono, Sans, Serif), Adobe Source (Mono, Sans,
      Seric), Fira (Mono, Sans), and Inter Sans.
   2. Optional parameter for scaling dark-mode font so that it optically matches
      light-mode. Fonts may appear visually different in light and dark mode
      when they are the same size. This scalar can be used to maintain equality
      of perceived size instead of actual size.
4. SCSS template for color schemes.
5. MathJax support set up for server-side rendering.
6. Formatting defaults for common personal and academic-related:
   1. About me page
   2. Publications page with the option of automatically pulling from Google Scholar
   3. Blogging
   4. Notes
   5. Search
7. Primary features work without JavaScript.
